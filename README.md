# fidelity-netbenefits
A MoneyMoney extension for Fidelity NetBenefits stock plan accounts

## Prerequesites
_ℹ️ This extension makes several assumptions about the format of numbers on the Fidelity NetBenefits website and so far has only been tested with non-US accounts. Make sure your "display currency" is set to a sane currency that uses commas as the decimial separators and dots as thousands separators._

## Installation

1. Only the [MoneyMoney beta version](https://moneymoney-app.com/beta/) can run custom extensions.
2. Download [fidelity-nb.lua](https://github.com/lumaxis/fidelity-netbenefits/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Copy the `fidelity-nb.lua` file to the MoneyMoney Extensions folder. This can most easily be found by letting the app itself open its `Database` folder. `Extensions` is a peer of that folder.
